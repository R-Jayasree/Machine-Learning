### Machine Learning Algorithms Laboratory - ICS1512

This repository contains all the code and materials for the **ICS1512 Machine Learning Algorithms Laboratory** course. The experiments cover fundamental machine learning concepts and their practical application using Python's scientific computing libraries.

### **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific experiment or assignment from the course.

  * **`Experiment_1/`**: Working with essential Python packages for machine learning, including `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Scikit-learn`, and `Matplotlib`.
  * **`Experiment_2/`**: Application of **Linear Regression** for loan amount prediction.
  * **`Experiment_3/`**: Application of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for the classification of e-mail spam data.
  * **`Experiment_4/`**: Application of the **Decision Tree Algorithm** for diabetes prediction.

### **Getting Started**

To run the code, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    Use the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/R-Jayasree/Machine-Learning.git
    cd Machine-Learning
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    Install all the necessary Python libraries using `pip`. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Run the notebooks:**

    Navigate to the respective experiment folder and open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). Ensure that any required datasets are located in the correct folder as specified in the notebooks.
